# Summary
I spend some time finding out how to create a GitHub page using a Jekyll theme. I did not want to build my blog page locally and then upload it, I prefer only to use [Microsoft Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Spending some time figuring out how I could do that I came across a workaround. Despite there being a ton of useful posts and articles on how to create a page I did not find something to describe it step by step. So I decide my first post to describe how I created [this page](https://0xdroot.github.io)

# Summary

I spend some time finding out how to create a GitHub page using a Jekyll theme, my preferred theme is [minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). I did not want to build my blog page locally and then upload it, I prefer only to use [Microsoft Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Spending some time figuring out how I could do that I came across a workaround. Despite there being a ton of useful posts and articles on how to create a page I did not find something to describe it step by step. So I decide my first post to describe how I created [this page](https://0xdroot.github.io)

# Prerequisites

There are some prerequisites before starting to build out the GitHub page. I will mention them briefly,
1. A GitHub account is necessary ;).
2. Installed on our computer the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and connect it with our GitHub account
3. Installed on our computer the [Microsoft Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and connect it with our GitHub account
4. Basic knowledge of how to use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
5. Using Google ;)
